Currently, I am working on a new design version 1.3, which was updated on Friday. This update includes several changes, such as new margins and paddings. In addition to the steady state, we have added better and worse states to the chart. I also fixed some previously incorrect resource names.

In the expanded chart view, we now have points that, when clicked, display a rectangular information view. The design itself has also been updated in version 1.3. There are still some minor UI component changes in progress. Once these are complete, I will begin investigating the test resources and writing unit tests to cover the repository layer.
